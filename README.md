# Malaria-metabolomics-CHMI
# Methodology: Malaria Metabolomics â€“ CHMI Studies

## Overview
The aim is to analyze metabolic profiles associated with malaria infection in CHMI studies to inform vaccine research.

## Steps
1. **Sample Preparation & LC-MS/MS Profiling**
   - Metabolite extraction from plasma
   - Profiling using LC-MS/MS

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Peak detection, alignment, and filtering
   - Batch correction and normalization (e.g., log transformation)

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Multivariate methods: PCA, PLS-DA
   - Univariate methods: t-tests, ANOVA
   - Feature selection using machine learning

4. **Biological Interpretation**
   - Pathway enrichment (e.g., Reactome)
   - Mapping to known metabolic pathways

5. **Tools**
   - Galaxy (Workflow4Metabolomics)
   - R (e.g., `MetaboAnalystR`)
   - Jupyter Notebooks

## Reproducibility Goals
- All code will be shared under an open-source license
- Metadata will follow FAIR guidelines
- Future upload to MetaboLights
